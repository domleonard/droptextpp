<b>Droptextpp text file preprocessor</b>
<b>
Template File Usage
</b>
  Template text files use the name of their output file, including its extension, with ".TPP" inserted before the extension.
  They may be drag and dropped onto a "<b>Drop Text Preprocessor (TPP)</b>" desktop launcher in the same or a separate Files window
  (.desktop files do not implement copy and pasting files onto them at time of writing).
  The launcher may be copied to different locations and/or renamed as needed to provide convenient access.

  Template files can contain any mix of text lines and preprocessor directives starting with a hash sign ('#') in column one.
  Dropping or pasting a template file onto a launcher will preprocess its content and update or rewrite its output file.

<b>
Terminal Usage:</b>

       <b> node ~/.droptextpp/droptextpp.js [-h] [-v] [-p] source</b>

where
  
  <b>-h</b>    displays help - any other command line arguments passed to droptextpp are ignored.
  <b>-v</b>    displays the version of Droptextpp installed and exits.
  <b>-p</b>    Write (pipe) preprocessor output to standard output (stdout).
    This option allows reading Droptextpp output in the terminal without writing it to a file,
    or redirecting it to a location provided in the command line, or piping it to another process.
    Without specifying this option the source file MUST be a template file and MUST have a file extension.
  
  <b>source
</b>
    Specifies the file path of the source file to be read by the preprocessor.
    Relative source paths in terminal are resolved against the current working directory, noting that
    drag and drop operations onto a desktop launcher generate absolute paths. 
        
    Source files must be encoded using "utf-8" with line terminators of ASCII CR, CRLF or LF characters.
    Output files are  encoded using "utf-8" with LF characters as line terminators.
    The -p option must be used if source is not a template file and/or Droptextpp output is to be written to stdout.
