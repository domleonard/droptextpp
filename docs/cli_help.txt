<b>Droptextpp text file preprocessor</b>
<b>
Template Files Usage
</b>
    Template text files are named after the output file they create or update with ".TPP" inserted before their file extension.
    They are dragged or pasted onto "<b>Drop Text Preprocessor (TPP)</b>" command under Windows, or dragged onto the same named launcher under linux.
    The command file may be copied from the installation folder (.droptextpp in the user's home directory) and/or
    renamed as many times as needed for convenient access.

    Template files can contain any mix of text lines and preprocessor directives starting with a hash sign ('#') in column one.
    Dropping or pasting a template file onto a command or desktop launcher preprocesses its content lines and updates or rewrites the output file.
    Pasting files onto launchers is not implemented in linux at time of writing.

<b>
Terminal Usage:</b>

   Windows:       <b>node %USERPROFILE%/.droptextpp/droptextpp.js [-h] [-v] [-p] source</b>
   linux:                    <b> node ~/.droptextpp/droptextpp.js [-h] [-v] [-p] source</b>

where
  <b>%USERPROFILE%</b> in Windows is refers to the users home folder
  
  <b>-h</b>    displays help - any other command line arguments passed to droptextpp are ignored.
  <b>-v</b>    displays the version of Droptextpp installed and exits.
  <b>-p</b>    Write (pipe) preprocessor output to standard output (stdout).
    This option allows redirecting output to a location provided in the command line, or piping it to another process.
    If this option is set, the source argument need not be a template file or have a file extension.
  
  <b>source
</b>
    Specifies the file path of the source file to be read by the preprocessor.
    Relative source paths in terminal are resolved against the current working directory, noting that
    cut and paste or drop operations in the file explorer GUI generate absolute paths. 
        
    Source files must be encoded using "utf-8" with line terminators of ASCII CR, CRLF or LF characters.
    Output files are  encoded using "utf-8" with LF characters as line terminators.
    The -p option must be used if source is not a template file or a non-default output file path is required.

  <b>-p</b>    Write (pipe) preprocessor output to standard output (stdout).
    wiithout this option the source argument MUST be a template file and MUST have a file extension.
